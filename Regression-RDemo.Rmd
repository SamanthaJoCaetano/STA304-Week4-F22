Let's work through the following R code:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


# Loading in Data


The `dpylr` package has some data about Star Wars characters. Let's assume it is a representative sample of all characters seen in Episodes 1 to 9.


```{r, message=FALSE}

starwars<-starwars

glimpse(starwars)

head(starwars)

```

Let's start by playing around with some SRS ratio estimation. Use the `svyglm()` function in the `survey` library to run a ratio estimation of mass given height. Assume it was a Simple Random Sample and use the finite population correction with $N=200$.

```{r}
#install.packages("survey")
library(survey)
## Using the Survey Library
N=200
n=nrow(starwars)

my.design <- svydesign(id=~1,
                       data=starwars,
                       fpc=rep(N, n))
  
svyratio(~mass, ~height, design=my.design)

svyratio(~mass, ~height, design=my.design, na.rm=TRUE)

```


Let's try taking this a step further playing around with some Stratified random sampling ratio estimation. Use the `svyglm()` function in the `survey` library to run a ratio estimation of mass given height. Assume the study wished to stratify by gender, use the finite population correction with $N=200$ and assuming 20% of the population are "feminine" and 80% are masculine.

```{r}
#install.packages("survey")
#library(survey)
## Using the Survey Library
N=200

# Let's find out the number of characters of each gender category in the sample.


# Now we need to create a weight variable for 20% fem and 80% masculine and then a second variable that spreads the weight amongst the sample.


# Since we are setting the design to be based on gender, we will remove any missing genders.


# Uncomment out the code, and fill in the weights and fpc variables based on your previous few lines of code. 

#strata.design <- svydesign(id=~1,
#                       strata=~gender,
#                       weights = ~samp_strata_weight, 
#                       data=starwars_noNA,
#                       fpc=~pop_strata_weight)


# Now let's see the reuslts:  
# svyratio(~mass, ~height, design=strata.design, na.rm=TRUE)

```



### Task 1 (5min): Create a Simple Linear Model to predict mass

Use the `svyglm()` function in the `survey` library to run a linear regression estimation of mass given height. Assume it was a Simple Random Sample and use the finite population correction with $N=200$.

```{r}
#install.packages("survey")
#library(survey)


```

What is the standard error of the intercept?

a. -13.81
b. 17.36
c. 0.64
d. 0.06

### Task 2 (4min): Create a Linear Model to predict mass

Use the `lm()` function in the `survey` library to run a linear regression estimation of mass given height.

```{r}
#install.packages("survey")
library(survey)

## Using the Survey Library
summary(lm(mass ~ height, data=starwars))

```

What is the different between the output here and the outcome in Task 1? What is similar?

(Try on your own) What happens if you change the $N$ in Task 1? Try setting $N=87, 200, 1000, 10000$


### Task 3 (3min): Create a Linear Model to predict mass

Run a linear regression estimation of mass given height and sex.

```{r}
## Using the Survey Library
n=87
N=200
fpc.srs = rep(N, n)

starwars.design <- svydesign(id=~1, data=starwars, fpc=fpc.srs)

mysvylm <- svyglm(mass ~ height + sex, starwars.design)
summary(mysvylm)

## Using lm
summary(lm(mass ~ height + sex, data=starwars))

```

Based on the output, what is the estimated mass of a male character who is 175 units tall?

Go to [pollev.com/sta](pollev.com/sta) to put in your answer.


### Task 4 (5min): Create a Logistic Regression Model to predict if mass exceeds 100lb.

Run a logistic regression model mass being over 100lbs given height and sex. 

```{r}
## Using the Survey Library

## Remove missing mass


## Create a new variable called `mass_over100`. 



## Create model using glm


```


Based off the above output, what is the predicted probability of a male who is 170cm tall being over 100lbs?
